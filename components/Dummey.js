    "Microsoft is the dominant force in business software, and a giant player in cloud computing. On Tuesday, the company made clear that its ambitions were even bigger, saying it planned to buy the powerhouse video game player Activision Blizzard for nearly $70 billion, in a deal meant to position the company for the next generation of the internet. The acquisition, Microsoft’s largest ever, would catapult the company into a leading spot in both the video game industry and could strengthen its hand in the nascent world of virtual and augmented reality. It is also a challenge to regulators in Washington, as Democrats and Republicans alike have pushed to limit the power of technology giants. Microsoft, which makes Xbox consoles and owns studios that produce hits like Minecraft, has expanded its gaming business to surpass $10 billion in annual revenue. In anticipation of a longer review, Microsoft said it did not expect the Activision deal to close until the next fiscal year, which ends in June 2023. Activision makes major hits like Call of Duty and Candy Crush, and the takeover would make Microsoft the world’s third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony, the company said. The industry has been consolidating rapidly, as it increasingly moves deeper into mobile and cloud gaming.The deal could also give Microsoft a significant boost against Facebook, which is considered the leader in the so-called metaverse, the name given to the virtual world. The metaverse is more of a buzzword than a thriving business, but companies are putting huge sums of money and talent behind the idea. Facebook renamed its parent company to Meta late last year to underscore its commitment. Adding Activision is a bet that consumers want to play major games anywhere — on phones, consoles, computers and eventually in virtual reality.";
